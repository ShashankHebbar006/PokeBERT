            "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",
            "",
            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran , but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult 's Dragon Darts and Weavile 's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene . Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking , Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta . Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola , Garganacl , and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely."

Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran , but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult 's Dragon Darts and Weavile 's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene . Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking , Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta . Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola , Garganacl , and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely."
