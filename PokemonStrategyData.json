            "Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable , Clodsire , and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W , Hawlucha , and Dragonite . Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Zapdos and Enamorus . Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Swords Dance Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, and hits Dragonite hard while still targeting Rillaboom . Gliscor greatly appreciates Tera Normal's immunity to Ghost-type attacks, most notably Hex from Dragapult and Gholdengo looking to turn Gliscor's Poison Heal into a liability. Its neutral typing against most threats is also helpful to handle foes like Kyurem better. Tera Normal should always be run alongside Facade to muscle past physically bulky threats like Moltres , Zapdos, and Alomomola after a Swords Dance. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively while letting it take on Fire-type Pokemon like Iron Moth and Cinderace more comfortably as well; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. A specically defensive spread allows Gliscor to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant , Dragapult, Raging Bolt , and Iron Moth, with the 36 Defense EVs letting it comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health. However, a physically defensive spread gives Gliscor the ability to better handle foes like Landorus-T , Cinderace, and Great Tusk , with 16 Special Defense EVs to survive both Enamorus's +1 Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S 's Psycho Boost from full health. Maximum Speed investment with an EV spread of 244 HP / 12 Atk / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature is also an option, as it allows Gliscor to Speed tie Kyurem and get the jump on Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott . Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight ; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Cinderace and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder.",
            "Gliscor is a premier Spikes user in the metagame. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace , setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including a boosted Iron Moth 's Fiery Dance, Choice Specs Dragapult 's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit 's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking , and Clodsire or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace and Moltres . Earthquake gives it a reliable STAB move to immediately threaten foes like Raging Bolt , Kingambit, and Iron Moth. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Toxic also works well with Earthquake, as it can be used to pressure Toxic-immune foes like Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo . Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user. Knock Off also complements its Earthquake, as it can be used to pop Air Balloon from Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Tinkaton that can otherwise wall Gliscor. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Walking Wake and Kyurem . On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene and Taunt Tera Flying Roaring Moon , which otherwise have extremely favorable matchups against the team. A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature checks Pokemon like Heatran , Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W 's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be run instead to let Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite , Iron Boulder , and Roaring Moon, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus 's Moonblast and +1 Raging Bolt's Dragon Pulse from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna , which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in, as well as Body Press from Zamazenta . However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time. Gliscor functions best on entry hazard-stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Walking Wake, Serperior , and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu , and Landorus-T . Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo , Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and the niche Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result."

            "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran , but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult 's Dragon Darts and Weavile 's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene . Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking , Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta . Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola , Garganacl , and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely."

            "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

            "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran , but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult 's Dragon Darts and Weavile 's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene . Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking , Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta . Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola , Garganacl , and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely."

On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep.

            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock.

            "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant , Iron Moth , Darkrai , and Ogerpon-W . It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt 's Thunderclap, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon . Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit , Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos 's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor , Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt . An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres , a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile , and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power. Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola , Corviknight , Skarmory , and Garganacl . Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo . Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost. Although it shares many weaknesses with Dragonite, Roaring Moon can utilize Taunt and Knock Off to severely disrupt defensive teams that Dragonite struggles against. Dragonite can use Extreme Speed to pressure fast threats like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon that can punish Roaring Moon's attempts to set up a Dragon Dance.",

            "Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable . Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T , common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory , Corviknight , and Air Balloon Gholdengo , all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran , but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult 's Dragon Darts and Weavile 's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene . Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking , Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta . Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola , Garganacl , and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely."
